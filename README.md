# TriviaGame
A contrived trivia game created with React.

# Gameplay:

First, select your options, then click the blue bar to start the game.

# Timers! 

As soon as the game starts, the timer begins to roll. Some of the answers to these questions might be able to be ascertained via google, if it weren't for the frustratingly diverse subject matter and needlessly confusing presentation.

# Do your best!

See convenient game results at the end of each question bank!

# How to help:

This game is an amateurs first attempt at React. There is only one component with state, but that state is too complex. The questions array needs to be removed from the main trivia game state.
